# News Application using Voice Assistant

The main goal of this project is providing news from around the world using a speech recognized software called Alan AI.

The web application works in the following manner:

1. User asks Alan AI for the latest news using commands like “What's up with PlayStation 5” or “Give me the latest Technology news”
2. The app requests for the information and displays top 10 relevant articles in a grid like format
3. The app further opens a particular article using additional commands like “Open the article no. 6”

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
